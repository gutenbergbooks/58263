<small>CARO AND TROLLEY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the entrance to the driveway leading to
the residence occupied by the President of the
Theological Seminary were two flat-topped
stone pillars, and upon one of these on a certain
bright September day, Trolley sat sunning
himself.</p>

<p>His handsome coat, shading from a delicate
fawn color to darkest brown, glistened like
satin; his paws were tucked comfortably away
beneath him, his long tail hung down behind,
and his golden eyes were almost closed; only
the occasional movement of his small aristocratic
ears showed him to be awake.</p>

<p>When Caro came dancing down from the
house he turned his head for a moment and
watched her sleepily till she was safely on top of
the other pillar, where she seated herself Turk-fashion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
her blue ruffles spread out carefully,
for Aunt Charlotte had cautioned her not to
rumple them. Caro had also been told not to
go out without her hat, so it dangled by its
elastic from her arm, while the sun shone down
without hindrance upon the fair little face with
its smiling blue eyes, and its crown of short
brown curls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trolley,&#8221; she announced presently, &#8220;here
comes the Professor of something that begins
with &#8216;Ex,&#8217;&mdash;I never can remember, it is such
a funny word. It sounds like the book in the
Bible where the Commandments are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Wells, the dignified Professor of New
Testament Exegesis unbent a little at sight of
the novel ornaments on the president&#8217;s gateposts.
&#8220;Why Miss Caro, you must have
wings!&#8221; he said, smiling up at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why no, I haven&#8217;t; and neither has Trolley.
He just jumps, but I have to climb. You
see that ledge there?&mdash;and this place&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear, that will do. Aren&#8217;t you
afraid you will fall?&#8221; the professor exclaimed
uneasily, as Caro leaned over to point out her
way of ascent. &#8220;I really think you had better
get down.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>&#8220;But it is very nice up here; you can see so
much,&#8221; the little girl assured him serenely, and
Dr. Wells went his way wondering if he ought
not to go up to the house and tell someone of
her dangerous position.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a bit afraid I&#8217;ll fall. There&#8217;s not
the least danger; is there Trolley?&#8221; Caro continued.</p>

<p>Trolley opened his eyes, yawned scornfully
and closed them again.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing I am afraid of&mdash;at least
I don&#8217;t like it, and that is the <i>dark</i>. I s&#8217;pose
you don&#8217;t mind it &#8217;cause you can see&mdash;I
shouldn&#8217;t either if I could see in the dark.
Aunt Charlotte says I mustn&#8217;t have a light to go
to sleep by, and I love a light,&mdash;I just <i>love</i> it!&#8221;
Caro&#8217;s eyes had grown sorrowful and her voice
had in it the sound of tears.</p>

<p>On the porch of the house back among the
trees Aunt Charlotte had waylaid the president.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do with Caro,
Charles. She isn&#8217;t exactly naughty,&mdash;and yet
you couldn&#8217;t say she was good either&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surprise me,&#8221; he replied, as his sister
hesitated. &#8220;She impresses me as a decided
character for one so young.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>&#8220;Decided! I should say so! You know&mdash;&#8221;
Aunt Charlotte continued, &#8220;Elinor put her in
my charge to be dealt with as seemed to me
best, and I did think after bringing up your
five that I knew something about it, but my
hand has lost its cunning. You know I have
never allowed a child a light to go to sleep by,
but Caro insists upon having one, and lies
awake and cries without it. What am I to do?
Let her cry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, I shouldn&#8217;t do that!&#8221; answered her
brother hastily, gazing into his hat as if he
hoped to find there some solution of the problem.
&#8220;Suppose you let me consider the matter,&#8221;
he added, as the striking of the hall clock
reminded him of his engagement; &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk
to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much good it will do,&#8221; said Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>With a book under his arm Dr. Barrows
started out, so absorbed in thought of his
small granddaughter that he passed through
the gate without seeing her till she called,
&#8220;Goodby grandpa!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Caro! Aren&#8217;t you afraid you will
fall?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>Caro shook her curls vigorously, and then
leaning forward she said plaintively, &#8220;Grandpa&mdash;please
don&#8217;t let Aunt Charlotte make me
sleep in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you are a foolish little girl,&#8221; replied
the president meaning to look stern, but succeeding
only in smiling fondly at the witch on
the pillar, who appropriated the smile and ignored
the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know God made the darkness, Caro,&#8221;
he continued, conscious that the remark was
not quite original.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;&#8221; unwillingly&mdash;then &#8220;but grandpa,
He put stars in <i>His</i> dark!&#8221;</p>

<p>As Dr. Barrows walked down the street he
reflected that he should have but a divided
mind to give to seminary matters, if the present
state of affairs continued, and the seminary
needed his close attention just now.</p>

<p>It was two weeks since his granddaughter
had arrived to spend several months in his
home while her father and mother were traveling.
&#8220;I am afraid we have spoiled her a
little,&#8221; his daughter Elinor wrote, &#8220;and hard
as it is for me to give her up I feel sure it will
be good for her to be in Aunt Charlotte&#8217;s hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
for a time. I know you will love her and forgive
her little failings, as you always did those
of&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Your devoted daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Love her! he was fairly bewitched by her.
He had thought a child in the house after so
many years of quiet might be annoying, but
on the contrary he would have liked to have
her always with him.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte was ready and anxious to do
anything and everything for her dear Elinor&#8217;s
child, but somehow her theories which had
worked so well with her brother&#8217;s children did
not seem to fit the next generation.</p>

<p>The truth was that in her southern home
Caro had been under a very different rule.
Mammy &#8217;Riah who had nursed her father before
her, had, to use her own words &#8220;Taught
her pretty manners,&#8221; and petted and scolded
and worshipped her. The result puzzled Aunt
Charlotte and delighted her brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the child
has that something,&mdash;her grandmother had
it&mdash;&#8221; and here the president fell to musing over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
those far-away days when he had fallen in love
with a pretty southern girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t let her make me sleep in the
dark:&#8221;&mdash;Caro&#8217;s grandfather felt positively
chivalrous in his determination to protect her&mdash;from
what? His own dear sister in whose wisdom
and devotion he had rested all these years!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE SILVER CANDLESTICK</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not for a moment to be supposed that
Trolley appeared in the first chapter simply because
he was picturesque. He was undoubtedly
handsome, and had a remarkable gift for elegant
attitudes. He would pose as dignity and
wisdom personified in the president&#8217;s arm chair,
or stretch himself in careless grace on Aunt
Charlotte&#8217;s choicest divan, and had even been
known to make a mantel ornament of himself
in an aspiring mood.</p>

<p>But above all else Trolley had a mind of his
own. For example he had chosen his home.
He began life at the Graysons&#8217; on Grayson
avenue, but as soon as he was old enough to
choose for himself he took up his abode with
the President of the Seminary.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte did not particularly care for
cats, and furthermore did not covet anything
that was her neighbor&#8217;s, so again and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Trolley was sent back, all to no purpose, and
at length he was allowed to have his way.</p>

<p>This was just at the time when the Graysons
and some others were bringing suit to prevent
the laying of a trolley line on the avenue, and
between the progressive people who wished
more rapid transportation than the stage which
passed back and forth once an hour, and the
old-fashioned residents who feared to have the
beauty of their street destroyed, and their quiet
disturbed by clanging bells and buzzing wheels,
feeling had grown exceedingly bitter.</p>

<p>Dr. Barrows himself had no special interest
in the matter, but some members of his family
were warm supporters of the railway, and when
the suit was decided in its favor one of his
nephews named the cat in honor of the event.</p>

<p>As Trolley he was known from that hour,
and he grew so large and handsome that even
Aunt Charlotte came to take pride in him. He
was amiable in disposition, but distant in manner
to all except Caro, who had won his heart
as he had won hers, at first sight.</p>

<p>He forgot his dignity and raced with her in
the garden like a frolicsome kitten, when she
was tired he allowed himself to be made a pillow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of, and to all her confidences he listened
with a sympathetic purr. In fact he did all he
could to keep her from being homesick.</p>

<p>There were of course times when his own
affairs demanded his attention. Bobby Brown
a yellow cat who lived two doors away needed
an occasional setting down for instance, and
other matters of this kind sometimes kept him
away for a day. It was on one of these occasions
that Caro quite tired out with searching
for him sat down on the doorstep and began
to miss mamma and the boys&mdash;&#8220;just dreadfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to do some shopping; do you
want to come?&#8221; asked her grandfather&#8217;s voice
behind her.</p>

<p>The clouds flew from her face in a minute,
for shopping with grandfather always meant
something interesting, if only a glass of ice
cream soda.</p>

<p>As they walked down town together, Caro
chattered away without a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to buy something for me,
grandpa?&#8221; she asked as they entered a large
grocery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see some wax candles in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
colors,&#8221; Dr. Barrows said to the clerk who
came forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why that sounds like Christmas or a birthday,&#8221;
exclaimed Caro.</p>

<p>But the candles brought out were too large
for Christmas trees, or cakes. They were of
all colors, and some were plain, others fluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What color do you prefer, Caro?&#8221; her
grandfather asked.</p>

<p>It was difficult to decide among so many
pretty ones, and she hung over them with a
finger on her lip and an expression of great
earnestness on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pink is lovely&mdash;and so is the blue, only
not quite so pretty,&mdash;and the green, and&mdash;yes
I like the violet too&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to take one of each, I see,&#8221; said
the president; and this greatly simplified the
matter. Six candles were selected&mdash;blue, pink,
green, red, violet and yellow, and these were
done up in a white paper parcel and handed
to Caro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now grandpa, what are we going to do
with them?&#8221; she asked when they were on the
street again.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a secret.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Caro gave a little jump of excitement. &#8220;I
love secrets;&#8221; &#8220;Please tell me what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it wouldn&#8217;t be a secret any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;two people can know a secret, and I
promise truly, bluely, I&#8217;ll not tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see about it when we get home,&#8221; her
grandfather replied, thereby causing her to be
in such a flutter of anticipation that as he told
her, he might as well have tried to keep step
with a yellow butterfly.</p>

<p>When at last they reached the study, Caro
looked on with deep interest while her grandfather
unlocked a cabinet and took from it a
small silver candlestick of beautiful design.</p>

<p>&#8220;How pretty! Is it to put the candles
in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Barrows glanced up at the portrait of a
sweet-faced young woman in an old-fashioned
gown, as he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;This candlestick belonged to your grandmother,
Caro, when she was a little girl, and
now I am going to give it to another little girl
who has her name, and who sometimes reminds
me of her. You are to put one of the candles
in it and put it on your dressing table, and
when the gas is out after you go to bed you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have a little candle-light to keep you from
being lonely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the dearest, sweetest, goodest
grandpa in the world!&#8221; Caro exclaimed with
a ferocious hug. &#8220;The dear little candlestick!
I&#8217;ll never be lonesome any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte shook her head and called it
a compromise, when the plan was explained to
her, but made no real objection to it.</p>

<p>There was a faculty meeting that evening in
the president&#8217;s study, and two of the members
had arrived and were talking with their host
when a shrill voice was heard crying: &#8220;Go
away Jane, I <i>will</i> call him! O grandpa!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Barrows rose hastily and left the room,
saying: &#8220;Excuse me gentlemen, my little
granddaughter is calling me.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the hall he had a vision of Caro&mdash;her
small red slippers peeping out from her long
white gown, her curly head looking over the
stair rail. Behind her was Jane, the upstairs
maid whispering sternly, &#8220;Come back Caro
this minute, you are a naughty girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just want you to see my candle lighted,
grandpa,&#8221; Caro said hopping down three steps
to meet him, and taking his hand while Jane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
retired shaking her head. She stood in great
awe of the president, and in her eyes a faculty
meeting was almost as sacred as a church service.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can turn the gas out, grandpa,&#8221; Caro
said, as after leading the way into her room,
she merrily kicked off the red slippers and
bounded into the middle of the bed.</p>

<p>From the door Jane saw the president laughing
as he stooped to kiss the saucy face.</p>

<p>Caro snuggled down beneath the cover and
when the gas was turned out, from the dressing
table came the clear, soft light of the candle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my little candle-star, grandpa, and I
don&#8217;t mind the dark now, &#8217;cause I can see it,
and it is soft and nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a funny child, Caro,&#8221; her grandfather
said, stroking her hair. &#8220;Suppose you
try to be a little candle yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why how could I?&#8221; Caro sat up much
interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about it to-morrow; they are
waiting for me in the study, I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I think I&#8217;ll be a pink one,&#8221; remarked
Caro meditatively, and Dr. Barrows went down
stairs with a smile on his lips.</p>

<small>THE GATE IN THE ORCHARD</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Caro</span> was in great haste to tell Marjorie
about her candle, and when she went skipping
around the corner next morning she met Marjorie
skipping in her direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why I was coming to see <i>you</i>,&#8221; they both
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Marjorie&#8217;s father was a younger brother of
Caro&#8217;s grandfather, and their home was not far
from the seminary. The little girls had already
become good friends, but as Marjorie had been
out of town with her mother they had not seen
each other for several days.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come to my house, Caro, for I have
something to show you,&#8221; her cousin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go to the orchard then,&#8221; Caro
suggested.</p>

<p>One of the many pleasant things about
Charmington was that it combined the delights
of city and country. Down on Main street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
there were stores large enough to supply all
reasonable desires, and yet five minutes&#8217; walk
in any direction brought you to the region of
wide lawns and forest trees; and back of some
of the pretty dwellings were orchards and
gardens in which you could easily forget there
was a town anywhere about. So it was in the
Barrows orchard, for years a favorite playground
for the children of the family.</p>

<p>Marjorie had some paper dolls and a new
book to show Caro, and these they carried with
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s run, so Tom won&#8217;t see us and want
to come,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Little Tom Turner who lived next door, was
in her opinion only useful as a playmate when
she had no one else, or to make up the necessary
number in some game, usually it was more
fun to run away from him. So they raced
through the long grass, brown curls and flaxen
braids bobbing up and down in their haste.</p>

<p>At the extreme end of the orchard there was
a large flat stone under a pear tree, and here
they sat down to get breath and look at the
dolls and the book.</p>

<p>Marjorie had a great deal to tell about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
visit, and as she listened Caro&#8217;s eyes presently
made a discovery. &#8220;Why there&#8217;s a gate! where
does it go?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>The boundary line of the Barrows&#8217; grounds
was marked by a rough stone wall, against
which grew currant and gooseberry bushes, and
almost hidden by these she noticed now for the
first time a gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Caro I&#8217;ll tell you, the people who
live over there aren&#8217;t nice at all. They got mad
at papa because of the trolley line, and they
won&#8217;t give any money to the seminary because
they are mad at Uncle Charles too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Persons who could be angry at her grandfather
certainly could not be nice, Caro thought.
&#8220;But what was the gate for?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A long time ago when Sister Alice and
Brother Charlie were little they used to play
with the Graysons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are there children there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed; that was a long time ago; but
Caro&mdash;&#8221; Marjorie&#8217;s voice sank to a whisper&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s
a man over there who has something
the matter with him. He can&#8217;t walk, and a
servant pushes him around in a chair. Nobody
ever sees him, but one day I peeped over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the fence and there he was, all wrapped up and&mdash;dear!
but I was scared!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t hurt you, could he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I suppose not, but he might say something
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well that wouldn&#8217;t hurt. I&#8217;d like to see
him,&#8221; said Caro.</p>

<p>All this was so interesting she had come near
forgetting her candle. Now she thought of it
and told Marjorie about it. &#8220;Just think,&#8221; she
added, &#8220;my own grandmother&#8217;s candlestick&mdash;when
she was a little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll ask mamma to give me one,&#8221;
Marjorie said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did grandpa mean when he said he
wanted me to be a candle? Do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He meant you must be good, I &#8217;spect,&#8221;
Marjorie replied in an offhand manner as she
picked some Spanish needles from her dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Candles aren&#8217;t good; that&#8217;s silly,&#8221; said
Caro scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, he meant something like that;
you ask him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did ask him that evening. It was just
at twilight and Dr. Barrows was sealing a letter
to his daughter when Caro seated herself on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
arm of his chair. &#8220;Can I talk to you
grandpa?&#8221; she asked; and as if he too wished
to join in the conversation, Trolley, with one
silent spring was on the study table, close to
the president&#8217;s elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll do for a paper weight, won&#8217;t he?&#8221;
laughed Caro, as the cat gravely seated himself
on the notes for to-morrow&#8217;s lecture. &#8220;And
he can lick your stamps for you,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Her grandfather laughed a little at this
bright idea. &#8220;Well Mischief,&#8221; he asked,
&#8220;what do you wish to talk about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know how I can be a candle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do candles do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; they make a little brightness&mdash;give a
little cheer. Can&#8217;t my girl do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjorie said you meant &#8216;be good.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yes, only I should say be loving and
kind. There are so many sad, lonely, worried
people in the world, who need a little cheer.
The very best way to be a candle is to love
people, Caro.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love <i>you</i>, grandpa!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you bring a great deal of cheer into my
life, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; with a pleased laugh. She put her
arms around her grandfather&#8217;s neck and pressed
her cheek to his for a moment, then with a
sudden change from seriousness to mischief,
she turned to Trolley. &#8220;Pussie,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;you must be a candle too. You must love
me, and you mustn&#8217;t be cross when there isn&#8217;t
any cream on your milk&mdash;and we&#8217;ll both shine
together.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE GRAYSON HOUSE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> pleasant afternoons the president and his
little granddaughter were frequently to be seen
walking down street together. Aunt Charlotte
found it very little trouble in these days
to get her brother to take his constitutional.
The sight of Caro looking like an autumn sprite
in her red jacket, was enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come grandpa, it is time for our walk,&#8221; she
would announce, and Dr. Barrows would
obediently lay down his pen or his book, and
follow. And the sight of her happy, rosy face,
as she frisked about in the fallen leaves, the
sound of her merry voice as she asked innumerable
questions, made him forget his anxiety
over seminary affairs, and before he knew it he
was looking up at the blue sky, breathing deeply
the delicious air, with something of the same
joyousness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;Grandpa, don&#8217;t you think that is a beautiful
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were walking out Grayson avenue, and
as Caro spoke she pointed to a large old-fashioned
mansion of gray stone, with a row of
stately pillars across its front. It stood in the
midst of extensive grounds where were many
fine trees and shrubs, in the background hot-houses
were to be seen, and nearer the street a
fountain was sending up a silvery shower.</p>

<p>A cloud crossed the president&#8217;s face as he
replied; &#8220;Yes, dear, it is a beautiful place.
That is where Trolley once lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any children there?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; Miss Grayson and her invalid brother
live there alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a very large house for just two persons,
Caro thought. &#8220;Did Trolley belong to
the sick brother?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; perhaps so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose he was sorry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely, but it couldn&#8217;t be helped you
know, Trolley was determined to live with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad he did,&#8221; said Caro.</p>

<p>She couldn&#8217;t ask any more questions for
Professor Rice joined them and began to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to her grandfather, but she could think, and
it presently occurred to her that this must be
the place that adjoined Marjorie&#8217;s orchard.
She walked along very soberly, her mind full of
the sick man no one ever saw, and the gate
that was never opened.</p>

<p>When she and Marjorie went over on the
avenue to mail a letter not long after this, Caro
asked, &#8220;Did you know that your gate opened
into the garden of the Grayson house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why yes, of course. Look Caro! there&#8217;s
Miss Elizabeth now!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were almost at the gate, and as Marjorie
spoke a tall, handsome woman crossed the
sidewalk and entered the carriage that was waiting
for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t she look cross!&#8221; Marjorie exclaimed.</p>

<p>But Caro was too much impressed with her
elegance to consider her expression, which was
not cross, by the way, only extremely sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s play dressing up,&#8221; she proposed,
&#8220;and I bid to be Miss Grayson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie was willing and chose to be Mrs.
Rice the professor&#8217;s wife who had at present
the distinction of being the seminary bride. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a coachman was needed, little Tom Turner who
sat on the curbstone longing for an invitation,
was offered the position, and perched on a piano
stool in front of a steamer chair he drove his
spirited horses&mdash;two rocking chairs&mdash;with
great skill.</p>

<p>Miss Grayson in an old silk gown of Aunt
Charlotte&#8217;s swept into her carriage with astonishing
dignity any number of times that morning,
followed by Mrs. Rice in a flowered
kimono.</p>

<p>When they grew tired of this play they went
to the orchard, and there Caro decided that it
would be quite easy to climb the wall if you
didn&#8217;t mind the currant bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not,&#8221; cried Marjorie, shocked
at such audacity, but when she was assured
that it was just lovely up there, she could not
resist and she and Tom followed.</p>

<p>It was an old-fashioned garden into which
the children looked, already rather brown and
bare except for a few chrysanthemums and
asters, but still with a beauty of its own quite
different from the smooth elegance of the
grounds in front of the house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>They sat there full of delight over their adventure,
craning their necks to see as far as
possible into this unknown land, when there
came the sound of footsteps on the fallen leaves.</p>

<p>Marjorie was down in an instant, and Tom
after her, but Caro waited till an invalid&#8217;s chair
appeared, rolled by a tall colored man. In the
midst of the rugs and shawls a handsome, boyish
face was to be seen, and Caro who had expected&mdash;she
didn&#8217;t know what&mdash;was so surprised
that instead of slipping down after Marjorie
as she had intended she sat perfectly still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop just here Thompson, I must have that
bit of view through the trees,&#8221; said the occupant
of the chair, and Caro saw he had a
camera.</p>

<p>She watched with interest till the right position
was found and the picture taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now turn me around, so I can get that
white birch against the stone wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Close to the birch sat Caro. &#8220;Wait a minute
and I&#8217;ll get down,&#8221; she called, remembering
how provoked Brother Arthur was when she
got in his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay just where you are,&#8221; a decided voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
commanded, and Caro staid, feeling not unlike
the convicts at the prison who had to have their
pictures taken whether they liked it or not.</p>

<p>It was over in a second and then down she
scrambled and ran after the other children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caro! what made you so long? what did
you see?&#8221; Marjorie cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but two men; but Marjorie they
took my picture!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Caro, maybe they are going to arrest
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they are,&#8221; Caro answered
gravely, &#8220;for do you know Marjorie he&mdash;the
sick man I mean&mdash;is very nice looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they walked back to the house she added,
&#8220;Just think how dreadful it must be not to be
able to walk.&#8221;</p>

<small>TROLLEY GOES VISITING</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Grandpa</span> tell me about the Graysons
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Barrows hesitated, for it was to him a
sad story. He and Caro sat together on the
wide hall sofa watching the wood fire that had
been started for the first time that afternoon.
Close to the hearth Trolley lay at full length
washing one of his front paws with a professional
air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am dreadfully afraid it is going to rain,&#8221;
Caro said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why my dear it is as clear as clear can
be!&#8221; her grandfather exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is sure to if Trolley washes behind his
ears,&#8221; she answered wisely, &#8220;But do tell me
please about the Graysons.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, as he did not like to refuse anything to
that curly head now leaning against his
shoulder, her grandfather told her about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
handsome Miss Elizabeth who when only a girl
had taken charge of her father&#8217;s house and
given a mother&#8217;s care to her young brother and
sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were their names?&#8221; asked Caro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Walter and Annette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they used to play with Charlie and
Alice; didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered her grandfather, with a
sigh, &#8220;Those were happy days. Well after a
while Mr. Grayson the father died, and then
little Annette, and there were only Miss Elizabeth
and Walter left in that great house. All
Miss Elizabeth&#8217;s love was lavished on this
brother and he was worthy of it&mdash;a wonderfully
fine fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in her grandfather&#8217;s tone caused
Caro to ask, &#8220;Did he die too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but in the midst of his college course
he lost his health. It was a strange, strange
thing, for he seemed perfectly well and strong,
and ever since then he has been growing more
helpless each year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And couldn&#8217;t anybody cure him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one; although his sister took him to the
wisest physicians in this country and abroad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
They were away for a long time but now they
have come home and have shut themselves in
with their sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjorie said they weren&#8217;t nice,&#8221; put in
Caro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjorie ought not to say that; she does
not understand. It was the trolley line on
Grayson avenue that made the trouble. Your
Uncle Horace was president of the railway company,
and this made the Graysons angry with
him, and it caused a break between the
families.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Barrows did not tell how he had attempted
to act as peacemaker and had been received
by Miss Elizabeth with a cold disdain
which showed him that he was included in the
bitter feeling she had toward his brother. And
what troubled him most was that in this way
his beloved seminary had lost one of its best
friends and most generous contributors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Elizabeth is a good woman,&#8221; he
added; &#8220;she built our beautiful chapel in memory
of her father and sister,&mdash;she can be generous
and kind, and I for one cannot speak
hardly of her, knowing her great sorrow. I
only wish I could do something for her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&#8220;Grandpa I have seen Walter, and I think
he is very nice looking. I saw him over the
fence at Marjorie&#8217;s and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear I think you&#8217;d better keep away
from the fence. I fear you have been prying,&#8221;
was the reply, and Caro did not tell the rest
of her story.</p>

<p>After she was in bed that night she lay awake
for a long time watching the little candle-star
and thinking of the young man who would
never walk again. Her grandfather&#8217;s tone in
speaking of him had impressed her deeply.
Walter must be one of those sad, lonely people
who needed a little cheer, and she wished so
much she could do something for him. Just
before she fell asleep an idea came into her
head.</p>

<p>Trolley&mdash;a vision of graceful curves&mdash;was
watching some sparrows quarreling together in
the top of a maple tree next day when Caro
pounced upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to be a candle and take a
little cheer to a person who is lonely&mdash;at least
I think he is, and if I were lonely I&#8217;d like to
have you come to see me, for you are a great
comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>Trolley amiably allowed himself to be
gathered up into her arms, taking the precaution
however to fasten his claws securely in the
shoulder of her red jacket.</p>

<p>It was very quiet around the seminary when
Caro with the cat made a short cut across the
campus to the avenue. A few minutes earlier
on her way home from market with Aunt
Charlotte, she had caught a glimpse as they
passed the Grayson house, of the muffled figure
in the invalid chair far back near the greenhouses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope he is still there, Trolley,&#8221; she
said, beginning to feel a little breathless, for
her burden was by no means light. &#8220;And I
hope we won&#8217;t meet a dog, for you&#8217;ll be sure
to run if we do,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>The Graysons&#8217; gate was reached however
without accident, no dog appeared, and the invalid
was still where she had seen him, but as
she went up the gravel walk Caro began to wish
she had not come. She almost expected to hear
Miss Elizabeth calling to her to know what she
was doing there.</p>

<p>Walter Grayson sat alone in the sunshine,
looking straight before him at a pot of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
curly white Chrysanthemums, and as Caro
made no noise in crossing the grass he was not
conscious of her approach until a deep drawn
sigh at his elbow caused him to turn with a
start.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible to carry Trolley
another step; too much out of breath to
speak, and with cheeks which matched her
jacket, she rested his weight on the broad arm
of the chair while she unhooked his front paws
from her shoulder. Walter watched her with
very evident surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sticks dreadfully,&#8221; she said, struggling
with the burr-like paws.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so;&#8221; the detaching process was
rather funny, and the invalid smiled.</p>

<p>Caro was feeling a little shy, and the smile
put her at her ease. She had lived all her life
among people who loved and petted her, and
it did not enter her mind that she could be unwelcome
anywhere unless she was naughty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought maybe you&#8217;d like to see him,&#8221;
she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very handsome; is he your cat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why just see! He likes you,&#8221; Caro exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
as after a few preliminary turns, Trolley
curled himself up on the soft rugs and began
to purr, thus expressing his unqualified
approval of this resting place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you the little girl I saw on the fence
the other day? Why did you run away?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caro laughed; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said;
and then feeling that her presence to-day needed
to be explained more fully, she added, &#8220;I
thought maybe you&#8217;d like to see Trolley, because
he is such a comfort to me when I am
lonely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you think I was lonely?&#8221; There
was a cloud on the young man&#8217;s face as he
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you must be,&#8221; she said simply,
&#8220;because you can&#8217;t go everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why are you lonely? You can go
where you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I miss mamma and papa and the boys
sometimes, and then&mdash;&#8221; she leaned against his
chair and spoke in a confidential tone, &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid of the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; Walter remarked gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you? I didn&#8217;t know grown up people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ever were&mdash;but if you&#8217;ll just get a candle you
won&#8217;t be&mdash;any more. The dark is very nice
when you can see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Walter seemed interested, watching her
gravely as he stroked Trolley, Caro went on to
explain more fully about the candle, and how
her grandfather had said she could be one herself.
&#8220;And so,&#8221; she concluded, &#8220;I thought
Trolley might be a candle too, and bring you
a little cheer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much obliged. What do you say his
name is?&#8221; Walter asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Charlie named him for the trolley
cars; wasn&#8217;t that funny? And he used to live
here you know&mdash;that is why I thought you
would like to see him. He came to our house
and just <i>would</i> stay, though Aunt Charlotte
sent him back ever so many times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I do recall something of the kind.
He was one of my sister&#8217;s pets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose she&#8217;d like to see him?&#8221;
Caro asked.</p>

<p>A smile flitted across Walter&#8217;s face as he replied,
&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know; she is out this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation was brought to an end by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the appearance of Thompson, who was no doubt
greatly surprised to find a little girl and a
striped cat with his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better go,&#8221; Caro said, &#8220;Aunt
Charlotte might want me, but Trolley can stay
awhile if you&#8217;d like to have him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trolley as if to expostulate against being
disturbed, tucked his head almost out of sight
and curled up tighter than before. No one
could have had the heart to disturb him.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is the child we saw on the fence the
other day, Thompson,&#8221; Mr. Grayson explained
as Caro ran off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir;&#8221; Thompson replied, watching till
the red jacket disappeared in the distance;
&#8220;She&#8217;s visiting here&mdash;she&#8217;s Dr. Barrow&#8217;s
granddaughter; I have seen her playing about.
Shall I take you down through the garden
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he was wheeled along the sunny path
there was a smile on Walter&#8217;s face. Caro had
been right, he was lonely, and after the first
moment he had not resented her sympathy, and
now the pressure of Trolley&#8217;s very substantial
frame against his arm, the thought of the little
girl&#8217;s face as she told about her candle, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
him a new sense of companionship. When he
had said he too was afraid of the dark, he was
thinking of the future which once had been so
bright to him, and over which the clouds had
gathered so heavily; but a little cheer had
found its way to his heart, and he could smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thompson, you needn&#8217;t mention it to Miss
Elizabeth,&mdash;the child having been here I mean&mdash;it
might annoy her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No sir;&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;And I hope
she&#8217;ll come again,&#8221; he added to himself, for he
did not approve of the dreary, shut-in life led
by his master.</p>

<small>A LOCAL SNOW STORM</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Caro reached home she began to be
afraid that Trolley would not come back and
the thought made her rather unhappy, but just
as the lunch bell rang he came trotting across
the lawn. She was watching at the window
and ran to open the door, giving him such a
warm welcome that the president who saw it,
remarked to Aunt Charlotte, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
what Caro would do without that cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>That very day Dr. Barrows left town on
seminary business and was gone several weeks.
Hard times had effected the seminary, an
effort must be made to increase its funds, and
this was the task the president had before him.
In this way it happened that he heard nothing
of the visit to Walter Grayson.</p>

<p>Caro missed him very much, for although
she and Aunt Charlotte were beginning to
understand each other, they would never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the intimate friends she and her grandfather
were.</p>

<p>When Marjorie heard the story she exclaimed,
&#8220;Why Caro! You had better not let
Aunt Charlotte know; she&#8217;ll scold you like
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caro was puzzled. Her grandfather had
said he was sorry for the Graysons and wished
he could do something for them. She had
thought of something&mdash;surely this couldn&#8217;t be
wrong, and yet she felt Marjorie was probably
right when she said Aunt Charlotte would not
approve.</p>

<p>About this time the little girls began to have
lessons together every morning, sitting in small
chairs on either side of the cutting table in their
aunt&#8217;s bedroom. They read from a small green
volume called &#8220;Little Annie&#8217;s Third Book,&#8221; a
favorite of Aunt Charlotte&#8217;s, from which she
had taught the children of the family for the
last forty years. Caro privately thought it
rather silly, but accepted it because mamma had
read in it when she was little.</p>

<p>Caro meant to try very hard while grandpa
was away, to be a pleasure and not an annoyance
to her aunt and Jane, so she might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a good report for him when he returned. During
the first week she succeeded so well that
Aunt Charlotte remarked to her sister-in-law,
Marjorie&#8217;s mother, that she had never known
two better children than those little girls.</p>

<p>Alas! it was not long before she was compelled
to change her opinion.</p>

<p>One afternoon when the ground was damp
and Marjorie had a cold, Miss Barrows told
them they might play in the garret. It happened
to be her reception day, and up there, she
thought, with the door closed they might make
all the noise they pleased without disturbing
the elegant repose of her drawing room.</p>

<p>Little Tom who as usual was hanging
around, was graciously invited in, and the three
ran off in high spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is anything there they
can possibly hurt,&#8221; Aunt Charlotte said to herself.</p>

<p>Now in this long, low room, near the front
windows was an old four post bedstead, upon
which was a large feather bed. It had not been
in use for a long time, and Aunt Charlotte was
planning to make some pillows out of it. Nothing
could have offered a more alluring playground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
than this mountainous bed; to climb
upon the cedar chest which stood near, and take
a flying leap into the middle of it, was tremendous
fun.</p>

<p>The excitement was growing when Marjorie
made a discovery. &#8220;Caro!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;the
feathers are coming out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough on one side of the mattress
there was a long rip, and from it the feathers
were beginning to fly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like a snowstorm,&#8221; exclaimed Caro,
taking her turn at jumping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goody, a snowstorm! Let&#8217;s pretend it&#8217;s
snowing,&#8221; Marjorie cried, and Tom clapped his
hands and danced with joy at the idea.</p>

<p>Such active exercise was heating, so they put
up the windows and then the fun grew fast and
furious. Around and around they went; up on
the chest, over on the bed, down on the floor,
screaming and laughing, while the feathers flew
in all directions, and the bed grew smaller and
smaller.</p>

<p>Trolley who looked in through the half open
door to see what was going on, ran down stairs
in disgust, and sitting on the bottom step of the
last flight sneezed and sneezed till Miss Barrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
who was entertaining Mrs. Rice in the
parlor couldn&#8217;t help wondering aloud what was
the matter with that cat!</p>

<p>&#8220;What charming children your little nieces
are, Miss Barrows,&#8221; Mrs. Rice remarked as
she rose to go.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte replied in gratified tones that
they <i>were</i> nice children, then as she opened the
door for her visitor, she exclaimed. &#8220;Can it
be snowing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely not; it is as mild as May,&#8221; said the
visitor.</p>

<p>But certainly the air was full of something
very like snow; both ladies were puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Miss Barrows it is <i>feathers</i>!&#8221; Mrs.
Rice cried, picking an unmistakable goose
feather from her sleeve. &#8220;See!&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte stepped to the edge of the
porch and looked up; yes, they came from the
third story windows, accompanied by a sound
of great merriment. Forgetting ceremony, she
left her visitor without a word, and climbed
the stairs as fast as her portly frame allowed.</p>

<p>What a scene met her eye! A scene of feathers
and wild hilarity. Breathing was almost
impossible and she quickly withdrew to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hall where, rapping sternly on the door, she
called &#8220;Children! children! what does this
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Presto! What a change! Three perspiring,
befeathered children came suddenly to themselves
and stared at one another in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll sweep them up and put them back,
Aunt Charlotte,&#8221; said Caro.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told Caro there was a rip, and that the
feathers would come out,&#8221; explained Marjorie
in a tone of injured innocence.</p>

<p>Quite speechless, Tom slid off the bed, now
a tearful sight in its dwindled proportions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of such badness,&#8221; Aunt
Charlotte gasped, and leaning over the railing
she called, &#8220;Jane&mdash;Jane! bring a whisk broom
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane came and the culprits were led into another
room and brushed and shaken until they
were thoroughly bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather pick chickens and be done with
it,&#8221; Jane remarked in disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Charlotte never said we mustn&#8217;t,&#8221;
Marjorie sobbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well who would ever have thought of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
doing a thing like this! Feathers all over the
neighborhood!&#8221;</p>

<p>Caro giggled nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;d laugh&mdash;it&#8217;s very funny. Just
wait till your grandfather hears about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Caro had a saucy reply on the end of her
tongue, but the thought of grandpa, checked it.
&#8220;Let your little candle remind you to be a
pleasure and comfort to Aunt Charlotte while
I am away,&#8221; he had said.</p>

<p>She had meant to be good, and she had been
dreadfully naughty, the sight of the disordered
room and the sorry looking mattress, and the
feather-strewn lawn, was proof enough.</p>

<p>She listened meekly when, dismissing Tom,
Aunt Charlotte took them into her room and to
use her own words, gave them a talking to.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose Mrs. Rice thinks?
Why our lawn might be a barnyard,&mdash;she actually
thought it was snow!&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of her repentance this made Caro
smile, and her aunt shook her head solemnly,
saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do with you
Caroline; I am ashamed of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m truly sorry Aunt Charlotte.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;If you are I don&#8217;t see why you laugh. Now
I believe Marjorie is sorry,&#8221; and Miss Barrows
looked with approval at that tearful maiden.</p>

<p>As if this were not disgrace enough for one
household, Trolley after he had recovered from
the feathers made his way into the kitchen and
stole one of the birds the cook was preparing
for supper.</p>

<p>Caro found him at dusk sitting in solemn
majesty before the hall fire, quite as if nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trolley,&#8221; she said, getting down beside
him on the rug, &#8220;do you know you have been
naughty too?&#8221;</p>

<p>He rubbed his head against her hand in a
manner that said as plainly as words, &#8220;Pet
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get a spanking, Trolley? I don&#8217;t
know what Aunt Charlotte is going to do to me.
You are so nice and soft; you are a great comfort.&#8221;
As Caro made a pillow of him Trolley
broke into a loud purr.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry I was naughty&mdash;I just didn&#8217;t
think a bit. It was such fun to see the feathers
fly. I wanted to be good while grandpa was
away, and now I&#8217;ve spoiled it. Oh dear, I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
mamma would come and take me home, I am
so lonesome!&#8221;</p>

<p>Trolley didn&#8217;t understand how anyone could
be unhappy before such a pleasant fire, with
him for company, and he continued to purr
loudly while Caro&#8217;s tears fell fast. His view
of things prevailed after a while, and when
Aunt Charlotte came down stairs she found
the two curled up together on the rug, fast
asleep.</p>

<p>The tear stains on Caro&#8217;s cheek softened her.
Perhaps the child really felt more than she
showed, and she decided she would not take
away her candle that night as a punishment, as
she had thought of doing. More than this she
let her have peach preserves for supper.</p>

<p>The preserves went to Caro&#8217;s heart and made
her more penitent than ever. &#8220;I&#8217;m truly going
to be good after this, and I&#8217;ll help Jane pick up
the feathers,&#8221; she said as she kissed her aunt
good-night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>IN THE GARDEN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> agreed that the weather was remarkable
that fall; far into November it lasted
warm and bright, and Walter Grayson who
found life more endurable under the open sky
than within four walls, spent a large part of
each day out of doors attended by his faithful
Thompson.</p>

<p>Caro&#8217;s visit had stirred anew his longing for
the old companionships that had once been his.
When at length after their long absence they
had decided to come home, he had looked forward
to it almost eagerly, but his sister whose
pride shrank from sympathy took it for granted
that to meet his old acquaintances could be only
painful to him, and those who had ventured to
call were not admitted.</p>

<p>Walter was in the habit of acquiescing in her
decisions, and in the first shock of his illness
he had felt the same shrinking from pity, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
now the sense of loneliness was becoming almost
unbearable. As he was wheeled about
the garden he lived over again the merry days
of his childhood, and the quarrel that had separated
him from those he had cared most for,
seemed a small matter in the light of these
memories.</p>

<p>The Graysons had long been people of wealth
and influence in Charmington, and in Miss
Elizabeth&#8217;s opinion it was a direct insult when
her wishes were ignored and the beauty of the
avenue which had been named for her grandfather
was, as she thought, forever ruined.
That her personal friends could side against
her, added to the bitterness. She refused to
see that Dr. Barrows was not responsible for
his brother&#8217;s actions, and proudly withdrew her
friendship from the whole family, and her gifts
from the seminary.</p>

<p>No doubt her grief over her brother made
her more bitter than she would otherwise have
been; at least so Dr. Barrows thought, and
would not speak ill of her.</p>

<p>Walter upon whom she lavished everything
affection could suggest, or money buy, felt that
he could not ask for the only thing he really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
wanted. And at times he told himself despondently
that he was forgotten, that his friends no
longer cared for him.</p>

<p>Caro&#8217;s simple friendliness had won his heart,
the possibility of seeing her again added a little
interest to his lonely life; and Thompson too,
seeing the good effect of her visit, was on the
watch for her.</p>

<p>When one afternoon they saw her in her
scarlet jacket, looking over the garden wall,
Walter waved his hand and Thompson grinned
broadly over the back of the chair, while Caro
nodded and smiled in response, quite as if they
had been old friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to see your picture?&#8221; Walter
asked; &#8220;they are on the library table,
Thompson,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>As the man went off Caro swung her feet
over on the Grayson side of the fence, and then
in another minute she had slipped down and
was beside Walter&#8217;s chair. &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t stay
long,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Marjorie has gone to the
dentist&#8217;s and I told her I&#8217;d wait till she came
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is the cat?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>&#8220;He is very well, thank you, but he has been
bad. He stole a bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and so have I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean you have stolen a bird?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caro laughed. &#8220;Of course not; I wouldn&#8217;t
steal, but Marjorie and Tom and I jumped all
the feathers out of Aunt Charlotte&#8217;s bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What naughty children,&#8221; said Walter
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Caro with a sigh, &#8220;and I
meant to be good while grandpa was away. I
promised him I&#8217;d try to be a candle and then
I forgot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by being a candle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;being pleasant and nice to Aunt
Charlotte and Jane,&mdash;not making trouble you
know. The feathers were all over the front
lawn and Mrs. Rice thought it was snowing.&#8221;
Caro laughed a little at the recollection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa said the best way to be a candle
was to love people, and I do love him ever so
much, but I don&#8217;t love Jane. I love Aunt Charlotte
too, but she doesn&#8217;t like to talk to me, so
I miss grandpa.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&#8220;I know how that is. I too wish sometimes
for someone to talk to,&#8221; Walter replied.</p>

<p>Here Thompson appeared with the photographs,
and everything else was forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are a little too grave,&#8221; Walter said,
comparing them with the glowing face beside
him; &#8220;We must try again sometime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And let&#8217;s have Trolley in it too,&#8221; Caro
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why certainly, that is a good idea. Do
you know Caro you remind me of my little
sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean Annette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why what can you know about her?&#8221;
Walter asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa told me. I asked him who lived
in your house&mdash;and then I saw her window in
the chapel&mdash;the Good Shepherd you know.
Grandpa said she was a dear little girl. Do I
truly look like her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is something in your face and
smile that is like her;&#8221; Walter looked thoughtfully
at the picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please tell me about her?&#8221;
begged Caro.</p>

<p>And so while Thompson wheeled his master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
up and down the garden paths, she walked beside
him and listened to the story of those days
when the gate now nailed up was always open,
and merry girls and boys ran back and forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nice times you did have!&#8221; Caro exclaimed,
pressing the palms of her hands together.
&#8220;I wish we could do some of those
lovely things. Couldn&#8217;t we have a picnic and
have a fire and roast potatoes and corn?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her interest was a pleasant thing to the invalid;
he laughed at the eager face; &#8220;Well,
why can&#8217;t we?&#8221; he said. &#8220;What do you think
Thompson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why of course we can, sir, if you like,&#8221;
was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And have Marjorie and Tom?&#8221; cried Caro
eagerly.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible to refuse her, but when
he thought of it afterwards Walter began to
doubt if he had been wise. What would his
sister think&mdash;or the Barrows, when it was discovered
that he had been entertaining the children
in the garden? Still it was too late now&mdash;he
had promised.</p>

<p>As for Caro no doubts spoiled her anticipation.
She gave Marjorie a most animated account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of the pleasure in store for them, and her
cousin was as interested as she could wish.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be lovely, Caro, and we&#8217;ll keep it a
secret,&#8221; she said, for there was nothing Marjorie
liked so well as a mystery.</p>

<p>Finding Tom, they proceeded to excite his
curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say&mdash;don&#8217;t you wish you knew what we
are going to do to-morrow?&#8221; they both exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; he asked,
pulling his ear and realizing that he was about
to be teased.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t tell, but it is something awfully
nice,&#8221; said Caro, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it Marjorie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it though!&#8221; and the two looked knowingly
at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be something to eat,&#8221;
Marjorie added.</p>

<p>&#8220;A candy pulling, I bet,&#8221; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;No indeed!&#8221; they both cried.</p>

<p>After carrying this on for half an hour and
goading Tom to the point of desperation, Marjorie
said, &#8220;If you&#8217;ll promise honest truly you
won&#8217;t tell you can come over to-morrow and
<i>maybe</i> we&#8217;ll let you into it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>&#8220;Truly I won&#8217;t tell,&#8221; Tom promised, brightening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you&#8217;d let him into it Caro?
He might spoil it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh I guess so,&#8221; Caro replied, and they ran
off leaving him alone with his curiosity.</p>

<p>All this mystery added not a little to the delights
of the picnic next day in the Grayson
garden, and certainly for its size there was
never a merrier one.</p>

<p>Tom was a little uncomfortable at first, for
Marjorie&#8217;s dark hints about the garden had impressed
him deeply, but he soon recovered from
this and helped Thompson make a fire on the
very spot where Charlie and Walter had built
theirs in days gone by.</p>

<p>The children thought nothing ever tasted so
good as the corn roasted there; there were
grapes and apples besides and some fascinating
bon-bons, but the corn was the most fun, they
insisted.</p>

<p>Not being in the habit of providing for such
feasts Thompson forgot the salt, and Marjorie
and Caro had the excitement of running to the
house and having the cook inquire what they
were going to do with salt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>On a seat made of a plank supported on
bricks the three children sat and feasted and
chattered, while Walter looked on and enjoyed
the experience of acting once more as host.</p>

<p>Everybody knows the peculiar pleasure of a
fire out of doors; the day was cool enough to
make its warmth agreeable, and the sight and
sound of the crackling flames was like a tonic
to the spirits.</p>

<p>After the feast was over they played games,
such as &#8220;I have a word that rhymes with&mdash;&#8221;
and &#8220;My ship comes sailing&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>They asked conundrums, and Thompson
showed himself to be an accomplished sleight-of-hand
man, finding silver dollars in impossible
places, and making handkerchiefs appear
and disappear, in a surprising manner. Never
was more fun crowded into one short afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a beautiful picnic, and I am
very much obliged to you,&#8221; Caro said to Walter
as they were separating.</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; echoed Marjorie, and Tom
would have said the same if he hadn&#8217;t been
bashful, as it was he could only grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just as much obliged to you for coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to my picnic,&#8221; Walter replied, and he added
to Caro, &#8220;Goodby little Candle.&#8221; This was
the first time in more than four years that he
had given any pleasure to anybody, he thought
on the way to the house.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth stood at the door: &#8220;Surely
Walter you are staying out too late,&#8221; she said:
&#8220;Are you not chilled?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all; you can trust Thompson for
that,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>As for Thompson, he wished Miss Grayson
could have seen her brother as he told stories
and laughed at the pranks of his visitors, and
he determined that if he could bring it about
there should be more occasions of the sort.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>MISS ELIZABETH RECEIVES A SHOCK</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Grayson</span> rejoiced in her brother&#8217;s unusual
cheerfulness, and when she was called
away for a few days to a neighboring city on
business she left with the less reluctance. Home
had after all proved the best place for him, she
thought.</p>

<p>She was gone several days, and at the last
minute after telegraphing that she would be
at home at eight in the evening, she found she
could take an earlier train that arrived at
three. There was no time for anything but a
hurried drive to the station, and she decided,
it would be just as well to surprise Walter.
How glad he would be to see her five hours
ahead of time! She felt quite happy over the
thought as she stepped from the train at Charmington.</p>

<p>There was of course no one to meet her, and
as the day was pleasant and the distance short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
she walked home. She might have taken the
street cars if her feeling on the subject had not
made it impossible.</p>

<p>It was only natural that the servant who
opened the door for her should seem surprised,
but Miss Elizabeth observed an odd hesitation
in his manner when in reply to her questions
he said Mr. Grayson was in the library.</p>

<p>To the library she hastened, and as she went
there came to her astonished ears the strains
of The Last Rose of Summer,&mdash;for years that
music box had been untouched&mdash;and mingled
with it was a sound like children&#8217;s voices. Before
her on a chair lay an unfamiliar scarlet
jacket with other articles of outdoor apparel,
and from the floor a pair of small but saucy
looking rubber shoes forced themselves upon
her vision. What did it mean&mdash;was she dreaming?</p>

<p>At the door she paused. In front of the
wood fire blazing brightly at one end of the
spacious room, Walter&#8217;s couch was drawn and
around him in attitudes of eager interest were
three children. They were evidently absorbed
in the story he was telling with an animation
his sister had thought never to see again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>Strewn upon the floor were photographs,
and on a table a costly illustrated book on birds&mdash;one
of her brother&#8217;s old favorites&mdash;lay open;
but at present everything else was forgotten in
the interest of the story which seemed to be one
of adventure, for there was frequent mention
of bears. This much Miss Grayson&#8217;s bewildered
mind took in.</p>

<p>And this was the lonely invalid to whom she
had hastened home! Certainly he was not
missing her, for she stood there quite unobserved.
And who were these children who had
brought such a light to his eyes? All her devotion
had failed to do as much for him. Turning
she saw Thompson hovering uneasily in the
distance, and swept down upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are those children in the library?&#8221;
she demanded. Miss Grayson was exceedingly
stately and Thompson felt abashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Miss Elizabeth they&#8217;re just some
children&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that; I asked who they are and what
they are doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well you see Miss Elizabeth it looked like
Mr. Walter was mighty lonesome to-day and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
it was too damp to be on the ground, so I just
took the liberty of asking them in to amuse
him. It looks like there&#8217;s not much for him
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Grayson tell you to ask them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No m&#8217;m, but he seemed right glad to see
them. It has cheered him up considerable.&#8221;
The sound of laughter from the library emphasized
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who <i>are</i> they?&#8221; Miss Grayson asked
again. Thompson was very trying to her, and
it was only because he suited her brother so
well that she kept him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly, ma&#8217;m; they are some
kin of Dr. Barrows over at the seminary I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was more than she could stand. Telling
herself that such excitement must be bad for
Walter she swept back to the library. The last
notes of music had died away, and Caro heard
the rustle of her dress and turned.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth had thrown back her fur collar,
in her face was an unusual glow, she was
very handsome Caro thought.</p>

<p>The eyes of the others followed hers, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a few seconds they all gazed at the lady in
silence. Then Walter found his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Elizabeth! I did not expect you so
early,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found I could get off sooner than I
thought when I telegraphed. I fear you are
tiring yourself,&#8221; she added coming to his side
and bending over him, entirely ignoring the
children.</p>

<p>Caro rose; &#8220;I &#8217;spect we&#8217;d better go,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;It is a lovely story, but if you are tired
we can come some other time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not tired, Caro,&#8221; Walter answered,
taking her hand, &#8220;but perhaps you&#8217;d better go
now, and as you say we will finish the story
another time.&#8221; They smiled at each other in a
way that expressed a world of friendly confidence.</p>

<p>Without another word Miss Grayson
turned and left the room. She felt she was a
marplot, and yet&mdash;those children&mdash;what else
could she have done? As she went up stairs
the sounds of laughter followed her; she wished
she had not hurried home.</p>

<p>She did not mention the children when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
returned to her brother after they had gone, but
talked of business and other matters, making
an effort to act as if nothing unusual had happened.</p>

<p>After dinner when they were alone together
before the fire, Walter spoke: &#8220;Elizabeth
there is something I want very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smoothed his hair caressingly from his
forehead as she replied, &#8220;You know dear if it
is anything I can give you, you shall have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this will be hard for you;&#8221; Walter
hesitated, then added, &#8220;It is my old friends
I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught her breath; &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>Then her brother told her about Caro&#8217;s visit
with Trolley. &#8220;It has made me feel,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;as I have thought about it since, that
I have been living very selfishly. My life as I
used to think of it has to be sure, been spoiled,
but there are still small things I might do&mdash;to
make a little cheer, as Caro says&mdash;and to begin
with I want my friends again. I want to forget&mdash;I
want you to forget&mdash;all that has been
unpleasant in the past.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>&#8220;And you think they will be willing to come
back to you, do you?&#8221; Miss Elizabeth asked
bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think they will,&#8221; he said simply.</p>

<p>Miss Grayson had often told herself there
was nothing she would not do for her brother,
but had she dreamed of anything like this?
Her proud heart had a fierce battle to fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t ever be Miss Elizabeth again when
we dress up; I don&#8217;t like her at all,&#8221; Caro said
as the children walked down the garden path
together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you she was cross,&#8221; Marjorie replied.</p>

<p>For lack of a better confidant Trolley heard
the story that night. &#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you one
bit for not wanting to live with her, for I &#8217;spect
she just scared you to death,&#8221; was Caro&#8217;s conclusion
emphasized by a vigorous hug.</p>

<small>ANNETTE&#8217;S WINDOW</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Marjorie,</span> grandpa is coming home this
afternoon; don&#8217;t you want to go to meet him?
Aunt Charlotte says we may go in the carriage.&#8221;
It was the first cold day of the season
and Caro looked like a bright-eyed squirrel in
her gray coat and chinchilla furs.</p>

<p>Of course Marjorie wished to go, and although
it was an hour and a half before train
time she put on her coat and hat and the two
went out to frisk up and down the walk until
the carriage came.</p>

<p>They went as far as the seminary chapel, and
seeing the door open Caro said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go in
and look at Annette&#8217;s window.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marjorie was willing and in they went.
Some one from a distance was giving a course
of Bible lectures to the students in the chapel,
and the one for that day was just over.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>It was a small building, beautifully proportioned
and decorated; the somewhat somber
richness of the interior being relieved by the
beautiful windows.</p>

<p>The children found it great fun to walk about
in perfect freedom instead of being obliged to
sit in sedate silence, and they forgot to think
about the time. They stood for a while before
the window on which was represented the Good
Shepherd freeing a lamb from a thorn bush,
and spelled out the words beneath it: &#8220;In
memoriam A. G.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to have a window,&#8221; Caro said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t unless you are dead,&#8221; Marjorie
answered.</p>

<p>Caro was disposed to doubt this and would
have begun to argue the question if the sound
of a banging door had not startled her. &#8220;What
was that Marjorie? I guess we&#8217;d better go,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>Pushing open the swinging door they went
out into the vestibule, and there they found the
outside door fast closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Marjorie, it is shut tight, I can&#8217;t open
it!&#8221; Caro cried.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Marjorie tried in her turn, but it was of no
use, the janitor not knowing they were in the
chapel had locked the door and gone away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do? We shall be late to
meet grandpa,&#8221; wailed Caro.</p>

<p>Marjorie began to pound on the door and
call, but this they soon realized could do no
good. &#8220;Nobody can hear us it is so thick,&#8221;
she said, beginning to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry Marjorie; maybe Clifford will
come back again. But I&#8217;m afraid we won&#8217;t get
out in time to meet grandpa,&#8221; Caro added with
a little choke in her voice at the thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clifford won&#8217;t be back till to-morrow I
know,&#8221; and Marjorie continued to sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;ll look for us, I know they will,&#8221;
Caro insisted.</p>

<p>It was dark and chilly in the vestibule so they
went back into the chapel where the air was
still warm. Even here the light was dim, for
the short afternoon was nearly over. The
shadows looked so dark in the corners that
Marjorie exclaimed, &#8220;Oh Caro I&#8217;m afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anything can happen to us,
and they will find us pretty soon I&#8217;m sure,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
said Caro encouragingly, although she couldn&#8217;t
help thinking how very dark it would be after
a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll starve! I am hungry now,&#8221; Marjorie
said tearfully.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but wait. They
sat down in the seat usually occupied by Aunt
Charlotte when they went to afternoon service
with her, two very forlorn little girls. Suddenly
Marjorie flung herself down on the cushions
and began to cry and sob wildly. Caro&#8217;s
tears fell more quietly, and after a time she
wiped them from her eyes and looked up at the
window. In the fading light she could just
see the gentle, tender smile of the Good Shepherd
as he rescued the lamb. It comforted her,
and when Marjorie&#8217;s passion of crying had exhausted
itself, she said softly &#8220;Marjorie look
at the Good Shepherd!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too dark to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjorie let&#8217;s ask him to send someone to
find us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Marjorie agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And soon,&#8221; Caro added, &#8220;And to help us
not to be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the dusk two little figures knelt, two little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
heads were bowed on the cushions. When
Caro lifted hers she thought something wonderful
had happened, for there was the Shepherd
smiling down on them just as if he were
about to speak. It was the electric light on
the campus which had shone out while their
eyes were closed, and made it seem almost like
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;We needn&#8217;t be afraid now Marjorie,&#8221; Caro
said calling her attention to it. &#8220;But I do
hope it won&#8217;t be very long, for I want so to
see grandpa.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Dr. Barrows was wanting
very much to see his little girl. When he
stepped from his carriage expecting to hear
her merry voice, and to see her flying to him,
there was only his sister standing in the door
with an anxious face, greeting him with:
&#8220;The children have disappeared Charles, and
can&#8217;t be found!&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few questions the president hurried
over to his brother&#8217;s, vague stories of kidnappers
floating through his brain. It seemed
strange indeed that two little girls could disappear
so completely in so short a time, leaving
no clew to their whereabouts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>The whole neighborhood was presently
aroused, and professors and students might be
seen running in every direction. Just how soon
it would have occurred to anybody to look in
the chapel it is impossible to say, but it so happened
that Dr. Smith the lecturer was to leave
town that evening, and in putting his papers
together he missed some valuable notes which
he thought must have been left on the desk in
the chapel. The janitor was sent for, and in
half an hour after the electric light shone out,
the children, as well as the manuscript, were
found.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so nice to be found!&#8221; Caro said, with
her arms clasped about her grandfather&#8217;s neck;
&#8220;but I truly wasn&#8217;t afraid after the light came,
for the Good Shepherd looked so kind.&#8221;</p>

<small>OLD FRIENDS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;There</span> is one thing I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221;
remarked Aunt Charlotte at the breakfast table,
&#8220;and that is how one of the Grayson servants
happened to come over here to ask about the
children yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Thompson, I guess,&#8221; said Caro who
was eating her oatmeal, stopping every other
minute to smile at her grandfather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Thompson?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the one who takes care of Walter,
and he is very nice. Why grandpa, he is almost
as good as Kellar; he can do all sorts of
sleight-of-hand tricks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how do you know anything about him
or Walter either?&#8221; asked Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>Then Caro remembered that she had not told
anyone about all that had gone on in the garden,
and she couldn&#8217;t think where to begin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you answer your aunt,&#8221; said her
grandfather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why yes&mdash;Aunt Charlotte,&mdash;I know them,&mdash;I
got acquainted with them a long time ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Walter Grayson? Why no one ever
sees him; you must be mistaken,&#8221; Miss Barrows
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I <i>went</i> to see him,&#8221; said Caro. &#8220;It
wasn&#8217;t wrong, was it grandpa? You know
you said to be a candle was to take a little cheer
to lonely people&mdash;and I was sure he must be
lonely. I thought maybe he&#8217;d like to see Trolley
&#8217;cause he lived there once, so I took him.
Do you think it was wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear I don&#8217;t know what to say&mdash;&#8221; the
president put down his knife and fork and
looked at Aunt Charlotte, and then at his granddaughter.
&#8220;You mean to say you took the
cat to see Walter Grayson?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caro nodded; &#8220;Yes, grandpa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what she&#8217;ll do next!&#8221;
cried Miss Barrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did he treat you?&#8221; questioned her
grandfather. &#8220;Did he tell you you were an
officious little girl?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&#8220;I think he liked to see me, &#8217;cause after that
we had a picnic.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the midst of these explanations a note was
brought in to the president. It read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Dear Dr. Barrows,&mdash;If you can spare the
time will you not come to see me within the
next day or two? I am anxious to have a talk
with you. If you have forgotten the way Caro
will come with you I am sure.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indent">&#8220;Your friend,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Walter Grayson</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Barrows read it aloud, and then looked
at his sister again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa he must think you are pretty
stupid if you could forget that little way,&#8221; Caro
said laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear I am rather stupid sometimes,&#8221; he
said smiling; &#8220;Well Pigeon we&#8217;ll go over there
after lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it came about that Caro and her grandfather
hand in hand, went over to the Grayson&#8217;s
that afternoon. Dr. Barrows still felt puzzled,
and half believed he was dreaming, but his
granddaughter was very wide awake indeed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
She quite hoped they would see haughty Miss
Elizabeth again, for with her grandfather beside
her she was ready to face anything.</p>

<p>The lady however was not to be seen, and
they found Walter alone in the library.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; was all the president said as
he grasped the hand stretched out to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much left of me, but what there
is is very glad to see you,&#8221; was Walter&#8217;s greeting.</p>

<p>It was well that Caro was there to help out
the conversation at first, her grandfather was
kept so busy clearing his glasses. She was as
full of life as the gray squirrel she resembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know we got lost yesterday?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; though I didn&#8217;t hear it till you were
found. What were you doing in the chapel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was open you know and so we went in
to look at Annette&#8217;s window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And weren&#8217;t you afraid when you found
the door shut?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a little, when it began to get dark&mdash;and
Marjorie was too. I thought it would be
so <i>dreadfully</i> dark after a while, and then the
electric light shone out, straight through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
window! We could see the Good Shepherd
just as plain as day, and I wasn&#8217;t afraid any
longer; then pretty soon they found us.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;&#8216;For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter quoted, smiling at Dr. Barrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Particularly when they are looking in the
right direction,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose Caro has told you how we became
acquainted,&#8221; Walter said; &#8220;and I have
found it so pleasant to have a friend that I want
more&mdash;I want my old friends again. I can&#8217;t
be of any use&mdash;&#8221; he was silent for a minute,
then went on, &#8220;I asked you to come because
I knew you could help me. My sister has given
her consent to anything I wish, but it is hard
for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will be happier in the end. She is too
fine a woman to shut herself in&mdash;the world
needs her,&#8221; answered Dr. Barrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;She <i>is</i> good, nobody knows it so well as I,&#8221;
said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now my boy anything I can do I will
do gladly,&#8221; the president added.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just to let my friends know that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
shall be glad to see them, and that on our side
all feeling about the old quarrel is put away.
And&#8221; he added almost gaily, &#8220;I think I shall
get Caro to help me with a Christmas party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Christmas party here? how lovely!&#8221; she
cried dancing up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to see the old house look really
cheerful again. Do you remember the parties
we used to have when we were children, Dr.
Barrows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean a tree, and Santa Claus?&#8221;
Caro asked coming to Walter&#8217;s side after whirling
around the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, and all the other things that belong
to Christmas,&#8221; was his reply.</p>

<p>Caro rather changed her mind about Miss
Elizabeth who met them in the hall as they
were leaving.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Barrows,&#8221; she said holding out her
hand, &#8220;I know what Walter has said to you&mdash;perhaps
I have been wrong&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, but
I should never acknowledge it except for
him&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The president interrupted her, &#8220;My dear,&#8221;&mdash;and
Caro wondered how he could call anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
so stately my dear,&mdash;&#8220;say no more. Let us
simply forget that anything ever came between
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Miss Elizabeth turned to Caro and
took her hand; &#8220;This is your granddaughter,
Elinor&#8217;s child,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I hope she will come
often to see my brother, he has taken a great
fancy to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached home Aunt Charlotte
met them with a letter in her hand. &#8220;What do
you think? Elinor writes that she will probably
spend Christmas with us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is mamma coming? How perfectly lovely!
Oh grandpa aren&#8217;t you glad?&#8221; Caro was so
full of delight she could hardly listen to her
mother&#8217;s letter in which Mrs. Holland said that
as they could not get their family together at
home, she would come to spend the holidays at
her father&#8217;s with Caro, while Mr. Holland
joined the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it is going to be the best Christmas
that ever happened,&#8221; Caro exclaimed.</p>

<p>The weeks before Christmas were merry
ones. As if to make up for his delay winter
came in earnest with a heavy snow followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
freezing weather, which made endless fun for
the children. To Caro snow that lay on the
ground for any length of time was a delightful
novelty, and she wanted to be out from morning
till night.</p>

<p>The cold kept Walter Grayson housed for the
greater part of the time but he was enlivened
by frequent visits from the children. For his
benefit they built a remarkable snow man on
the lawn outside the library windows and Miss
Elizabeth said not a word, although her order-loving
eyes found the grotesque object almost
painful. It amused Walter, and so she could
endure it.</p>

<p>He and Caro spent hours over plans for the
Christmas party, to which his sister had offered
no objection, but she asked no questions and
shrank from having anything to do with it.</p>

<p>The days flew by as they always do at this
time of year, with so much to prepare for and
look forward to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trolley,&#8221; Caro said one evening, &#8220;I am
sorry for you, because you don&#8217;t know what
fun Christmas is. Just think! Mamma is coming
to-morrow, and Charlie and Alice, and we
are going to have the best time!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Trolley only purred contentedly. All days
were alike to him, if he had plenty to eat and
a comfortable nap, and the society of his
friends.</p>

<small>CHRISTMAS CANDLES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sunlight fell softly through Annette&#8217;s
window and across the reading desk as Dr.
Barrows began the afternoon service in the
chapel on the day before Christmas. The air
was fragrant with the odor of cedar and pine,
and against the dark oak wainscoting the holly
berries shone warm and bright, as he read:
&#8220;The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee,
the fir tree, and the pine tree, and the box together,
to beautify the place of my sanctuary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caro sat with her hand clasped in her mother&#8217;s,
the happiness of Christmas shining in her
face; across the aisle was Marjorie with
Charlie and Alice.</p>

<p>Just as the president began to read, the door
opened and Thompson swiftly and noiselessly
wheeled his master to a place at one side of the
pulpit, and withdrew. Caro thought Walter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
must be lonely there by himself, so after a moment&#8217;s
hesitation, with a smile she withdrew
her hand from her mother&#8217;s and stole softly up
to the front seat close to the invalid.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth saw her from the back of
the chapel where she sat, and tears came to her
eyes. She had not wanted her brother to come,
and now here was this child taking the place
that should have been hers.</p>

<p>When her grandfather read his text Caro
looked up at Walter and smiled; it seemed
meant for them she thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;To give light to them that sit in darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is to be doubted if the president ever
preached a better sermon, and yet it was only
a simple little talk that the children could understand,
about the Light-bringer whose love
could penetrate the darkest clouds of sin or
sorrow, and whose followers must in their turn
become light-bearers.</p>

<p>Caro listened, looking up at the Good Shepherd,
who again seemed to smile on her. But
after they had sung, &#8220;It came upon the midnight
clear&#8221;&mdash;and the benediction had been
pronounced, the merry side of Christmas became
uppermost. There was Charlie exclaiming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
&#8220;Walter old fellow I am so glad to see
you!&#8221; and shaking hands warmly, and Alice
and Mrs. Holland with quieter greetings. Marjorie
and Tom of course joined Caro, and the
president came down and added one more to
the group around Walter.</p>

<p>At the door Miss Elizabeth waited, unable
to escape altogether the friendly greetings, trying
not to be impatient, while near her stood
Thompson with a beaming face. This was
something like living he thought.</p>

<p>There is something about Christmas eve
which makes it different from all other evenings.
There is a thrill of expectancy in the air
that no one can quite escape, even though his
head is grey. Caro and Marjorie skipped down
the stone walk in the frosty air, hand in hand,
brimful of happiness; Charlie and Alice were
beside Walter, and Dr. Barrows who walked
with Miss Elizabeth thought his little granddaughter
was right when she said this was going
to be the best Christmas that ever happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; said Walter, as they were
separating, &#8220;that I depend on you to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to make my party a success. It is to be as much
like old times as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be on hand and do our best,&#8221; said
Charlie. &#8220;Poor fellow! what a change from
four years ago,&#8221; he added to his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet I can&#8217;t quite pity him. It must
be because he is so brave,&#8221; Alice answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Bess, you will wear your prettiest
gown, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; Walter had said coaxingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t care for such things any
more,&#8221; Miss Elizabeth urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must. I want you to look like a
queen,&#8221; he insisted, and so when the Barrows
arrived next evening they found their hostess
in creamy satin and costly lace, with diamonds
on her breast and in her dark hair. At sight
of her Caro clasped her hands and cried, &#8220;Oh
Miss Elizabeth you are perfectly beautiful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her admiration was so evidently genuine
that the lady could not help being pleased, and
she stooped and kissed the rosy cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you think we came?&#8221; asked
Marjorie, dancing around till the blue bows on
her flaxen braids danced too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I forgot to tell you,&#8221; cried Caro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
running to Walter&#8217;s side, &#8220;We came through
the gate,&mdash;Charlie opened it, the gate in the
orchard. We shan&#8217;t have to climb the fence
any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The invitations read &#8220;To meet Miss Caro
Holland&#8221; and Caro in her fluffy white dress
with a spray of holly on her shoulders stood
beside Miss Elizabeth and Walter and helped
receive the guests. The spacious house was all
thrown open, brilliantly lighted and beautiful
in its Christmas decorations, for neither trouble
nor expense had been considered.</p>

<p>It was first of all a children&#8217;s party as every
Christmas party should be, but there were almost
as many grown people asked besides, to
enjoy the children&#8217;s pleasure. Aunt Charlotte
was there in her black velvet gown, and Mrs.
Rice in her wedding dress,&mdash;everybody in fact
looked their best.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth hardly knew herself with
flowers and music and happy faces all about her,
she almost forgot the pain at her heart, and her
brother&#8217;s contented smile paid her for all her
struggle.</p>

<p>The tree which was in the library was a most
beautiful sight when the lights were turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
down in the other rooms and the doors thrown
open. The floor appeared to be covered with
snow, and the tree was all in white and silver,
blazing with candles.</p>

<p>After it had been sufficiently admired, Santa
Claus came on the scene with a generous pack
from which he distributed the most interesting
white parcels tied with red ribbons. One of
these which had on it &#8220;For Trolley, in care of
Caro,&#8221; contained the prettiest sort of a collar
on which was a silver plate with his name.</p>

<p>Supper was served on small tables decorated
in holly and red candles, and when this was
over the children danced and played around the
tree, while the older people strolled about the
house or sat and talked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you had a good time Caro?&#8221; asked
Walter, catching her hand as she danced by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I have,&#8221; was her answer, &#8220;and I&#8217;m
so much obliged for everything, especially Trolley&#8217;s
collar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he will like it. I owe a great deal
to Trolley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt if you ever would have come to see
me if he had not put it into your head.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8220;And then we shouldn&#8217;t have had the party,
should we? Here comes grandpa,&#8221; she added.
&#8220;Have you had a good time grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This has been a happy Christmas, Walter,&#8221;
the president said sitting down beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been to me. And I had not expected
to have another happy one,&#8221; Walter replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Santa Claus bring you,
grandpa?&#8221; Caro asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I most wanted,&#8221; and Dr. Barrows
smiled at Walter. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how
much I thank you; I had come home rather
discouraged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please tell me what it is,&#8221; begged his granddaughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a piece of paper, Caro,&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;One that will help the seminary out of its
difficulties,&#8221; added the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean money? That isn&#8217;t interesting,&#8221;
laughed Caro. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I
think,&#8221; she continued, shaking her finger at
Walter, &#8220;I think you are a candle, a big one!
Hasn&#8217;t he brought us a great lot of cheer,
grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has indeed, my darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man&#8217;s face flushed. &#8220;Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
I have done has brought me the most pleasure.
I seem now not to mind as I did at first having
to give everything up. I can even hear Charlie
talk about the university, without thinking of
my spoiled plans. I only want now to get what
I can out of the present.&#8221; Then after a moment&#8217;s
silence, he said with a smile, &#8220;I am not
afraid of the dark any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you try a candle?&#8221; Caro asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes;&#8221; Walter answered, and Dr. Barrows
understood. On that young life with its dark
shadow, the light of love had shone, and a little
candle had been the beginning of it.</p>

<p>So the Christmas party came to an end, and
the guests went happily home through the snow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>GOODBY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Trolley</span> sat on the gate-post. If possible he
was handsomer than ever, for the frosty
weather had made his coat thick and fluffy, besides
this he wore his new collar. His eyes
were wide open to-day, and he looked out on
the world with a solemn questioning gaze.</p>

<p>He had been decidedly upset in his mind that
morning at finding an open trunk in Caro&#8217;s
room, and clothes scattered about on chairs and
on the bed. Of course he did not know what
this meant, but to the cat mind anything unusual
is objectionable, and it made him unhappy.
Finally he stretched himself in the tray,
where Caro found him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You darling pussie!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Mamma
do look at him, I believe he wants to go home
with us. I wish we could take him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Holland said one little girl was all
the traveling companion she cared for. &#8220;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
wouldn&#8217;t do dear, he would be unhappy on the
train,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I should have done without
him. He and my candle were my greatest
comforts,&mdash;except grandpa,&#8221; and Caro put her
cheek down on Trolley&#8217;s soft fur.</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I to do without my little
candle?&#8221; her grandfather asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why you can have the cat,&#8221; Caro answered
merrily.</p>

<p>No wonder Trolley&#8217;s mind was disturbed
that morning with such a coming and going as
went on,&mdash;people running in to say goodby, and
Aunt Charlotte thinking every few minutes of
something new for the traveler&#8217;s lunch, tickling
his nose with tantalizing odors of tongue and
chicken.</p>

<p>It was over at last, trunks and bags were sent
off, Aunt Charlotte was hugged and kissed and
then Trolley had his turn, and the procession
moved, headed by the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodby Trolley; don&#8217;t forget me!&#8221; Caro
called, walking backwards and waving her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>When they were out of sight Trolley went
and sat on the gate-post and thought about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
After a while he jumped down and trotted
across the campus with a businesslike air as if
he had come to an important decision. He took
his way through the Barrows&#8217; orchard to the
Grayson garden where there was now a well-trodden
path through the snow.</p>

<p>Miss Grayson and her brother were sitting
in the library. They had been talking about
Caro when Walter glancing toward the window
saw a pair of golden eyes peering in at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is Trolley,&#8221; he said, and called
Thompson to let him in.</p>

<p>Trolley entered as if he was sure of a welcome,
and walking straight to Miss Elizabeth,
sprang into her lap; and from this on he became
a frequent visitor at the Graysons, dividing his
time in fact about evenly between his two
homes.</p>

<p>And thus an unfortunate quarrel which had
disturbed the peaceful atmosphere of Charmington
and separated old friends, was forgotten,
and as the president often remarked, it was all
owing to the candle and the cat.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
